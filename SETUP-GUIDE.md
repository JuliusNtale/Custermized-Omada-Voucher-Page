# Quick Setup Guide - Email Notifications

## ✅ REALISTIC SOLUTION: Server-Side Email Notifications

**Why this works:** Customer's portal request goes through Omada's system to your server, then your server emails you. No customer internet required!

## 🚀 Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Upload Webhook File
1. ✅ Upload `simple-email-webhook.php` to your web server
2. ✅ Edit line 32 in the file: Change `your-email@gmail.com` to your actual email
3. ✅ Make sure your server supports PHP and mail() function

### Step 2: Update Portal
1. ✅ Edit `index.js` line 9: Change `https://yourserver.com/simple-email-webhook.php` to your actual webhook URL
2. ✅ Example: `https://myserver.com/simple-email-webhook.php`

### Step 3: Test
1. ✅ Upload the updated ZIP file to Omada
2. ✅ Test a bundle purchase
3. ✅ Check your email for purchase notification

3. **🎫 Create Voucher** - Generate voucher in Omada Controller
4. **📱 Send Voucher** - WhatsApp/SMS the voucher to customer

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Email Not Received?
1. Check your server's PHP mail configuration
2. Check spam folder
3. Check webhook URL in `index.js`
4. Look at browser console for error messages

### Webhook Not Working?
1. Check the URL is accessible: Visit `https://yourserver.com/simple-email-webhook.php` in browser
2. Should show: `{"error":"Method not allowed"}` (this is normal for GET requests)
3. Check server error logs

### Alternative: Use Console Logging
If webhook fails, the system logs to browser console. Open browser Developer Tools (F12) → Console tab to see purchase requests.
